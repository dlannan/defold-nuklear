# defold-nuklear

An extension for Defold to provide Nuklear immediate mode gui capabilities. 
General reasoning for this extension development:
- Needed gui with drawing
- Needed to be able to build gui targets for web asm
- Wanted tp have a simple "one header" style solution (ended up with a few files).
